    <p>
        Complete the function, which calculates how much you need to tip based on the total <br>
        amount of the bill and the service. <br>
        <br>
        You need to consider the following ratings: <br>
        <br>
        Terrible: tip 0% <br>
        Poor: tip 5% <br>
        Good: tip 10% <br>
        Great: tip 15% <br>
        Excellent: tip 20% <br>
        The rating is case insensitive (so "great" = "GREAT"). If an unrecognised rating is received,  <br>
        then you need to return: <br>
        <br>
        "Rating not recognised" in Javascript, Python and Ruby... <br>
        ...or null in Java <br>
        ...or -1 in C# <br>
        Because you're a nice person, you always round up the tip, regardless of the service. <br>
